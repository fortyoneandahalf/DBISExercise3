Most of the program is already implemented:

- Boilerplate for Hibernate session generation
- Menus and navigation
- Bean classes
- Hibernate mappings for Immobilie, Makler and Person classes

Still to do:

- Hibernate mappings for remaining Bean classes:
  - Haus
  - Wohnung
  - Vertrag
    - Kaufvertrag
    - Mietvertrag
- Logic in ImmoService class. I think all of the necessary methods are there, but they're all handled using in-memory Sets defined in the ImmoService class. So we need to get rid of this Set-oriented logic and replace it with equivalent code for the Hibernate classes. (This is basically what the TODO comment at the top of the ImmoService says.)
